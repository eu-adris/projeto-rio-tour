                <h3>A escadaria selarón</h3>
                <p>Rio de Janeiro is full of colorful places that will make your eyes turn, and a perfect destination like that is the vivid mosaic Stairs of Selarón - a magical spot in the middle of a metropole. The stairs are the beautiful work of Chilean-born artist Jorge Selarón, who saw the project as his tribute to the city and the Brazilian people. He completely transformed the neighborhood turning it from a gray abandoned area into a creative hub for tourists.</p>
